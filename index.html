<h3><strong>ABOUT ME</strong></h3>
<p>

<br/>
As I had stated earlier I'm still persuing my education and focused on achieving my academic goals.
Science explains alot but I believe God is behind it all,in that case i am a strong believer and always looking forward to spread His word.

<h3><strong>INTERESTS</strong></h3>
<p>
Basically I have no specific hobbies.too many things amaze me and i always try to do them all.I like challenging myself so im not stuck to one activity.
The only thing i do most and always desire to is 'eating the frog first',i wouldnt call it a hobby though;)
